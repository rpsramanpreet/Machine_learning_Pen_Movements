# Machine_learning_Pen_Movements
This project explores machine learning approaches for classifying handwritten digits from pen trajectory data (UCI Pen-Based Digits dataset). Using 10,992 samples of 16 pen-movement features, we compare preprocessing techniques, classification algorithms, and dimensionality reduction methods to build an optimal digit recognition system.
